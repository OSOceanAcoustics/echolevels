Discussions on water column sonar data processing levels.

- Discussion section from our 2020 OER proposal: [from_proposal.md](from_proposal.md)
- Notes from brainstorming meetings
  - [2022-07-12](discussion_2022-07-12.md). Includes photos of diagrams we drew on the whiteboard

## Links to NASA product levels documents

- [EarthData: Data Processing Levels. Description of data processing levels ranging from Level 0 to Level 4 for NASA EOSDIS data products.](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/engage/open-data-services-and-software/data-information-policy/data-levels). The standard table of levels and descriptions, plus an introduction paragraph, from a modern-looking NASA EarthData site.
- [science.nasa.gov: Data Processing Levels.](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-science-data/data-processing-levels-for-eosdis-data-products/). Same table as the EarthData page, with a shorter introduction paragraph.
- [EOS Data Products Handbook, Volume 2. October 2000](https://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/data_products_vol2_0.pdf). Starts in Foreword page IV. The introductory paragraph is a bit longer than in the other sites. The "List of Data Products (Organized by Mission Name)" that starts in page 10 provides a compact summary of the various products and levels generated from each instrument, especially for Levels 2 and higher. This is a helpful, detailed but compact view that's not available in the other sites.

## Additional relevant discussions not captured in the proposal discussion

- [CESBIO/Theia multitemp: The product level names, how they work ?](https://labo.obs-mip.fr/multitemp/the-product-names-how-they-work/). This is a *very* nice discussion. It covers NASA, CEOS, the THEIA Land Data Center (what's used in CESBIO/Theia?), and the author's own personal recommendation or version. Includes a brief discussion on product level name "letters" (eg, 1B, 2A).
