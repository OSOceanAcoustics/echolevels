# README

The [University of Washington Echospace group](https://uw-echospace.github.io) is developing a categorization of water column data products from active sonar systems, particularly echosounders, by **Data Processing Levels**. The primary outcomes will be a document describing these data processing levels, including a review of the use and scope of processing levels for environmental monitoring data in general and echosounder data specifically; and an implementation in [echopype](https://echopype.readthedocs.io), a Python package built to enable interoperability and scalability in ocean sonar data processing.

This repository contains the working document describing these data processing levels together with some background materials and ongoing discussions. A snapshot of this working document is available as a Jupyter Book at https://uw-echospace.github.io/data-processing-levels/. The latest, working version of the document is currently found in a [Google document (restricted access)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cAdz3eGicSAAglLtfCJv-1M1TREX7ElPzebhpEMnqMY/edit).

We welcome [input or questions via GitHub issues!](https://github.com/uw-echospace/data-processing-levels/issues/new)
