# Echosounder Data Processing Levels

The [echopype](https://echopype.readthedocs.io) team is developing the specification of a set of ["Data Processing Levels"](./review.md) that categorizes data products derived from water column sonar (echosounder) data.

See [](./background.md) for why this is important, [](./review) for a review of the use and scope of processing levels for environmental monitoring data, and [](./echodata_existing.md) and [](./echodata_proposed.md) for existing and proposed echosounder data processing levels. The proposed data processing levels are implemented in the software [echopype](https://echopype.readthedocs.io).

We welcome [input or questions via GitHub issues](https://github.com/uw-echospace/data-processing-levels/issues/new)!
