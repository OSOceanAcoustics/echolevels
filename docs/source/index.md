# Echosounder Data Processing Levels

The [University of Washington Echospace group](https://uw-echospace.github.io) is developing a categorization of water column data products from active sonar systems, particularly echosounders, by **Data Processing Levels**. The primary outcomes will be a document describing these data processing levels, including a review of the use and scope of processing levels for environmental monitoring data in general and echosounder data specifically; and an implementation in [echopype](https://echopype.readthedocs.io), a Python package built to enable interoperability and scalability in ocean sonar data processing.

This Jupyter Book site contains a snapshot of this working document. The latest, working version of the document is currently found in a [Google document (restricted access)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cAdz3eGicSAAglLtfCJv-1M1TREX7ElPzebhpEMnqMY/edit).

We welcome [input or questions via GitHub issues!](https://github.com/uw-echospace/data-processing-levels/issues/new)
