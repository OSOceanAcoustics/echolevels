# Echosounder Data Processing Levels

We (the [U Washington Echospace group](https://uw-echospace.github.io)) are developing the specifications of a set of ["Data Processing Levels"](./review.md) that categorizes data products derived from water column sonar (echosounder) data.

This document provides a review of the use and scope of processing levels for environmental monitoring data, and describes the proposed set of echosounder data processing levels, which are implemented in the software [echopype](https://echopype.readthedocs.io).

We welcome [input or questions via GitHub issues!](https://github.com/uw-echospace/data-processing-levels/issues/new)
