# Existing implementations

At present we are aware of only two implementations of echosounder data processing levels, one from the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) {cite}`haris_imos_2018,haris_sounding_2021` and the other from the Atlantic Deepwater Ecosystem Observatory Network (ADEON) {cite}`heaney_adeon_2020`.

## IMOS
The IMOS SOOP-BA NetCDF convention (Ships Of OPportunity Bio-Acoustic {cite}`haris_imos_2018,haris_sounding_2021`) uses the broader IMOS "file_version" processing level categorization for marine data. The categorizations includes:
- L0: raw data
- L1: quality controlled data
- L2: derived data products

The IMOS SOOP-BA data are stored in a NetCDF format that is metadata-rich and follows broad ocean and earth science data and metadata standards. The data products include many variables, such as uncorrected and unfiltered Sv, processed Sv (motion correction and a series of noise filtering), metrics derived from Sv, and ancillary oceanographic data. Unmodified raw data files are archived and made available only upon request (Haris, K., pers. comm.).


## ADEON
ADEON developed a set of six processing levels (L0-L5) for passive and active acoustics {cite}`heaney_adeon_2020`:
- L0: raw, unprocessed data files generated by instruments
- L1: calibrated time series data, including calibrated volume backscattering strength (Sv)
- L2: the first level of data processed from the calibrated data, such as depth-integrated Sv with noise removal applied
- L3-L5: higher-order processing, including signal classifications, interpolated products and synthesis or modeled products.

The ADEON specification contains [a table](https://adeon.unh.edu/sites/default/files/user-uploads/ADEON_Data%20Processing_Specification_FINAL.pdf#page=9) that compares the ADEON levels with those from NASA EOS and the French IFREMER program {cite}`ifremer_processing_2019`. In practice, the ADEON focus for active acoustics was largely on L0-L2. Widely used data formats such as CSV are used for the resulting products.
