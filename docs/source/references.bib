	abstract = {This paper represents an attempt to standardize the terminology used in satellite data processing and utilization from raw sensor counts to end products. The proposed processing level nomenclature (PLN) and the flow structure are based on the authors' experience with the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data production and are intended to complement and enhance the PLN currently used for the Earth Observing System (EOS) datasets. The proposed four-level structure is designed considering two major groups: (1) data producers and (2) data users. The A and B levels of the structure are primarily oriented to serve the first group, consisting mostly of remote sensing specialists, whereas the C and D levels fit better the purposes of scientists in the second group (e.g. weather-climate numerical modelers) that are interested in end products but not in remote sensing methodology. A simple PLN is proposed to facilitate communication between producers and users of satellite data.},

	abstract = {Approaches from metrology can assist earth observation (EO) practitioners to develop quantitative characterisation of uncertainty in EO data. This is necessary for the credibility of statements based on Earth observations in relation to topics of public concern, particularly climate and environmental change. This paper presents the application of metrological uncertainty analysis to historical Earth observations from satellites, and is intended to aid mutual understanding of metrology and EO. The nature of satellite observations is summarised for different EO data processing levels, and key metrological nomenclature and principles for uncertainty characterisation are reviewed. We then address metrological approaches to developing estimates of uncertainty that are traceable from the satellite sensor, through levels of data processing, to products describing the evolution of the geophysical state of the Earth. EO radiances have errors with complex error correlation structures that are significant when performing common higher-level transformations of EO imagery. Principles of measurement-function-centred uncertainty analysis are described that apply sequentially to each EO data processing level. Practical tools for organising and traceably documenting uncertainty analysis are presented. We illustrate these principles and tools with examples including some specific sources of error seen in EO satellite data as well as with an example of the estimation of sea surface temperature from satellite infra-red imagery. This includes a simulation-based estimate for the error distribution of clear-sky infra-red brightness temperature in which calibration uncertainty and digitisation are found to dominate. The propagation of these errors to sea surface temperature is then presented, illustrating the relevance of the approach to derivation of EO-based climate datasets. We conclude with a discussion arguing that there is broad scope and need for improvement in EO practice as a measurement science. EO practitioners and metrologists willing to extend and adapt their disciplinary knowledge to meet this need can make valuable contributions to EO.},

	abstract = {Obtaining accurate and widespread measurements of the vertical structure of the Earth’s forests has been a long-sought goal for the ecological community. Such observations are critical for accurately assessing the existing biomass of forests, and how changes in this biomass caused by human activities or variations in climate may impact atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Additionally, the three-dimensional structure of forests is a key component of habitat quality and biodiversity at local to regional scales. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) was launched to the International Space Station in late 2018 to provide high-quality measurements of forest vertical structure in temperate and tropical forests between 51.6° N \& S latitude. The GEDI instrument is a geodetic-class laser altimeter/waveform lidar comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 transects of structural information. Over its two-year nominal lifetime GEDI is anticipated to provide over 10 billion waveforms at a footprint resolution of 25 ​m. These data will be used to derive a variety of footprint and gridded products, including canopy height, canopy foliar profiles, Leaf Area Index (LAI), sub-canopy topography and biomass. Additionally, data from GEDI are used to demonstrate the efficacy of its measurements for prognostic ecosystem modeling, habit and biodiversity studies, and for fusion using radar and other remote sensing instruments. GEDI science and technology are unique: no other space-based mission has been created that is specifically optimized for retrieving vegetation vertical structure. As such, GEDI promises to advance our understanding of the importance of canopy vertical variations within an ecological paradigm based on structure, composition and function.},
