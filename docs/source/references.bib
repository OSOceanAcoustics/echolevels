	abstract = {This paper represents an attempt to standardize the terminology used in satellite data processing and utilization from raw sensor counts to end products. The proposed processing level nomenclature (PLN) and the flow structure are based on the authors' experience with the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data production and are intended to complement and enhance the PLN currently used for the Earth Observing System (EOS) datasets. The proposed four-level structure is designed considering two major groups: (1) data producers and (2) data users. The A and B levels of the structure are primarily oriented to serve the first group, consisting mostly of remote sensing specialists, whereas the C and D levels fit better the purposes of scientists in the second group (e.g. weather-climate numerical modelers) that are interested in end products but not in remote sensing methodology. A simple PLN is proposed to facilitate communication between producers and users of satellite data.},

	doi = {10.1088/1681-7575/ab1705},
	abstract = {Approaches from metrology can assist earth observation (EO) practitioners to develop quantitative characterisation of uncertainty in EO data. This is necessary for the credibility of statements based on Earth observations in relation to topics of public concern, particularly climate and environmental change. This paper presents the application of metrological uncertainty analysis to historical Earth observations from satellites, and is intended to aid mutual understanding of metrology and EO. The nature of satellite observations is summarised for different EO data processing levels, and key metrological nomenclature and principles for uncertainty characterisation are reviewed. We then address metrological approaches to developing estimates of uncertainty that are traceable from the satellite sensor, through levels of data processing, to products describing the evolution of the geophysical state of the Earth. EO radiances have errors with complex error correlation structures that are significant when performing common higher-level transformations of EO imagery. Principles of measurement-function-centred uncertainty analysis are described that apply sequentially to each EO data processing level. Practical tools for organising and traceably documenting uncertainty analysis are presented. We illustrate these principles and tools with examples including some specific sources of error seen in EO satellite data as well as with an example of the estimation of sea surface temperature from satellite infra-red imagery. This includes a simulation-based estimate for the error distribution of clear-sky infra-red brightness temperature in which calibration uncertainty and digitisation are found to dominate. The propagation of these errors to sea surface temperature is then presented, illustrating the relevance of the approach to derivation of EO-based climate datasets. We conclude with a discussion arguing that there is broad scope and need for improvement in EO practice as a measurement science. EO practitioners and metrologists willing to extend and adapt their disciplinary knowledge to meet this need can make valuable contributions to EO.},

This data descriptor provides an overview of such bioacoustic data from Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) Bioacoustics sub-Facility. Until 30 September 2020, more than 600,000 km of data from 22 platforms were processed and made available to a publicly accessible Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN) Portal. Approximately 67\% of total data holdings were collected by 13 commercial fishing vessels, fostering collaborations between researchers and ocean industry. IMOS Bioacoustics sub-Facility offers the prospect of acquiring new data, improved insights, and delving into new research challenges for investigating status and trend of mesopelagic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems have numerous benefits for human societies around the world and many policy initiatives now seek to maintain the health of these ecosystems. To enable wise decisions, up to date and accurate information on marine species and the state of the environment they live in is required. Moreover, this information needs to be openly accessible to build indicators and conduct timely assessments that decision makers can use. The questions and problems being addressed demand global-scale investigations, transdisciplinary science, and mechanisms to integrate and distribute data that otherwise would appear to be disparate. Essential Ocean Variables and marine Essential Biodiversity Variables, conceptualized by the Global Ocean Observing System and the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network, respectively, guide observation of ocean. Additionally, significant progress has been made to coordinate efforts between existing programs, such as the Global Ocean Observing System, Marine Biodiversity Observation Network, and Ocean Biogeographic Information System collaboration agreement. Globally and nationally relevant indicators and assessments require increased data sharing and sharing of analytical methods, sustained long-term and large-scale observations, and resources to dedicated to these tasks. We propose a vision and key tenets as a guiding framework for building a global integrated system for understanding marine biological diversity and processes to address policy and resource management needs. This framework includes: using Essential Ocean Variables and Essential Biodiversity Variables and implementing the principles of FAIR data and action ecology. In doing so, we can encourage relevant, rapid, and integrative scientific advancement that can be implemented by decision makers to maintain marine ecosystem health.},

	abstract = {In the next decade the pressures on ocean systems and the communities that rely on them will increase as multiple stressors of climate change, food security and human activities start to impact. Our ability to manage and sustain our oceans will depend on the data we collect and the information and knowledge generated. Much of the uptake of this knowledge will be outside the ocean domain, for example by policy makers, local Governments, custodians and other organizations, so it is imperative that we democratize or open the access and use of ocean data. This paper looks at how technologies, scoped by standards, best practice and communities of practice, can be deployed to change the way that ocean data is accessed, utilized, value added and transformed into information and knowledge. The current portal-download model which requires the user to know what data exists, where it is stored, in what format and with what processing, limits the uptake and use of ocean data. Using examples from a range of disciplines, a web services model of data and information flows is presented. A framework is described, including the systems, processes and human components, which delivers a radical rethink about the delivery of knowledge from ocean data. A series of vision statements describe parts of the future vision along with a series of recommendations about how this may be achieved. The paper recommends the development of virtual test-beds for end to end development of new data workflows and knowledge pathways. This supports the continued development, rationalization and uptake of standards, creates a platform around which a community of practice can be developed, promotes cross discipline engagement from ocean science through to ocean policy, allows for the commercial sector, including the informatics sector, to partner in delivering outcomes and provides a focus to leverage long term sustained funding. The next ten years will be ‘make or break’ for many ocean systems. The decadal challenge is to develop the governance and co-operative mechanisms to harness emerging information technology to deliver on the goal of generating the information and knowledge required to sustain oceans into the future.},

	abstract = {Maintaining healthy, productive ecosystems in the face of pervasive and accelerating human impacts including climate change requires globally coordinated and sustained observations of marine biodiversity. Global coordination is predicated on an understanding of the scope and capacity of existing monitoring programs, and the extent to which they use standardized, interoperable practices for data management. Global coordination also requires identification of gaps in spatial and ecosystem coverage, and how these gaps correspond to management priorities and information needs. We undertook such an assessment by conducting an audit and gap analysis from global databases and structured surveys of experts. Of 371 survey respondents, 203 active, long-term ({\textgreater}5 years) observing programs systematically sampled marine life. These programs spanned about 7\% of the ocean surface area, mostly concentrated in coastal regions of the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Seagrasses, mangroves, hard corals, and macroalgae were sampled in 6\% of the entire global coastal zone. Two-thirds of all observing programs offered accessible data, but methods and conditions for access were highly variable. Our assessment indicates that the global observing system is largely uncoordinated which results in a failure to deliver critical information required for informed decision-making such as, status and trends, for the conservation and sustainability of marine ecosystems and provision of ecosystem services. Based on our study, we suggest four key steps that can increase the sustainability, connectivity and spatial coverage of biological Essential Ocean Variables in the global ocean: (1) sustaining existing observing programs and encouraging coordination among these; (2) continuing to strive for data strategies that follow FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable); (3) utilizing existing ocean observing platforms and enhancing support to expand observing along coasts of developing countries, in deep ocean basins, and near the poles; and (4) targeting capacity building efforts. Following these suggestions could help create a coordinated marine biodiversity observing system enabling ecological forecasting and better planning for a sustainable use of ocean resources.},

Underlying this is a distributed ocean observing framework that is integrated, interoperable, interactive, and accessible. In recognition of the 30th anniversary of Fisheries Oceanography the journal, this paper reviews the evolution of observing instruments and platforms used in contemporary fisheries oceanography the science. Illustrated with personal anecdotes, past efforts to create or adopt observing technologies, and examples of their use in research, this highlights the spectrum of instruments, systems, and programs used to survey and monitor ocean ecosystems. Modern ocean observing systems are complex and varied, reflecting the range and diversity of data required by fisheries oceanographers. These systems require a large and ongoing investment and an interdisciplinary community of scientists, engineers, and technicians to design, build, install, operate, and maintain them. Common themes emerge from a review of past successful instrument R\&D and deployments. It is a highly collaborative, integrative, and iterative process. Most systems are the result of vision, planning, and perseverance, backed by careful calibration and intercomparison. Long-term support is essential; public–private partnerships that leverage funding, technology, and infrastructure are critical. Sustaining long time series for monitoring population and ecosystem change and to support fisheries oceanography research is a priority. Future areas of focus include continuously innovating and updating technologies, implementing a backbone of core observations, and maintaining a nimble infrastructure and R\&D capacity to seize new opportunities and address emerging challenges.},

	abstract = {Our synthesis combines inferences from a long-term fisheries monitoring survey and principles of ecosystem oceanography to inform and benefit biodiversity monitoring and modeling studies within the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We review the history, research, and application of the Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Survey, highlighting how one survey of life can illuminate understanding of pelagic biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function (from micronekton to top predators to ecosystem services) that may be easily extended to other surveys to strengthen observation networks. Biodiversity is often used as the standard for understanding ecosystem resilience to climate or anthropogenic disturbances. This concept is central to our review, and we examine it in relation to complex impacts resulting from a recent climate event (a marine heatwave) on biodiversity, ecosystem function, and socioeconomic services. We present a system of interconnected modules that summarize and illustrate patterns of pelagic biodiversity using a phylogenetic approach, known modulations and environmental drivers of variability (i.e., source waters, habitat compression, and ecosystem shifts), remote sensing and modeling tools for monitoring biodiversity (i.e., seascapes and krill hotspot models), and the status of top predator biodiversity. We use these modules to summarize connections between biodiversity and ecosystem services provided. Following each module, a brief discussion of questions raised and recommendations for future studies and partnerships is provided to improve future integrative biodiversity monitoring. Additionally, we invested in promoting data accessibility and outreach, resulting in several data visualization and ecosystem context tools for biodiversity monitoring and fisheries management. We advocate that a diverse integrated ecosystem approach should result in fewer ecological surprises by putting past events and surprises into context, and thus better anticipating those yet to arrive. Building partnerships among researchers and coastal communities will result in increased capacity of analytical tools and perspectives to ensure sustainable use of fishery resources, while strengthening the resilience of fishing communities.},
